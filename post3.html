		  <p>Almost 350 years after the storm, the Dom remains without a nave. Will it ever return? The Dom Church, and especially its tower, is the symbol of the city. Should this powerful symbol be restored to its old glory? Or is the new space created between the tower and the transept something worth savoring?
		  </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Dom: Pride of Utrecht</h2>
			
			<p><b>With its 112.5 metres in height, the Tower of St. Martin's Cathedral is the tallest church tower in the Netherlands and the main landmark of Utrecht.
			</b></p>
			
          <p>From the start of the construction of the tower in 1321, the Dom Tower has been a symbol of power and defiance against the influence of the neighboring regions, and especially Holland. The tower was 70 meters higher than the rest of the church.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><b>On a clear day, it could be recognized all the way from the major cities in Holland.</b>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>Throughout the centuries, the Dom Church remained  a symbol of Utrecht. It is one of the very cases that leads to the term <i>campanilismo</i> (local patriotism), where the patriotism and the attachment to one's own city derives from its bell tower (in Italian: <i>campanile</i>). The bell towers distinguish one town or region from another, and become symbols for local patriotism. 
		  </p>
		  		  		  
		  <p><b>The Dom Tower has been celebrated as a beacon of pride throughout the centuries.
		  </b></p>
		  
		  <p>The Dom has become a symbol of its own, and as such has appeared in many important works of art. One of the most famous examples is the <i>Mystic Lamb</i> by the brothers Van Eyck (1426-1432, Saint Bavo Cathedral, Ghent). For a long time it was questioned whether the tower was original to the painting, or it was added during a restoration in 1550 by Jan van Scorel, a painter from Utrecht.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>During the last restoration, completed in 2019, it has been established that the tower is original. That means that it is the oldest surviving image of the Dom Tower, which was exactly fifty at the time.

		  <p>Also after the collapse of the nave, the Dom Church remained the symbol of the Utrecht. Nowadays, it the Dom Tower appears on countless souvenirs, such as magnets, t-shirts, key rings and many more. The symbol can also be spotted on the T-shirt worn by the players Utrecht's football club (FC Utrecht), displaying some Utrecht <i>campanilismo</i>.</p>

		  <p>The Dom Church and its tower are still one of the biggest tourist attractions in Utrecht, with 400.000 visitors in 2018. In that same year, 84.000 people climbed the Dom Tower to enjoy its incredible views over the city it has come to represent.</p>
		  
         

          <h2 class="section-heading">Plans to rebuild the dom</h2>
							
			<p>Over the  past decades, and perhaps for much longer, some people have been dreaming of restoring the nave to its former glory. In 1974, the 300th anniversary of the storm, the foundation Rebuild Dom Church was founded to research the possibility of bringing back the nave.</p>
			
			<p> <b>The resurrection of the nave is to be completed on August 1st 2074, exactly 400 years after the storm.</b> </p>
			
			<p>The foundation would want to reconstruct the nave according to the principle of 'slow building'. Just like the original constructors of the church did in medieval times, the foundation aims to build the nave step by step. Only small groups of people will be working on it at the same time.</p>
			
			<p><i><b>"The construction site will facilitate places for learning and for working."</i></p></b>
			
			<p>The Foundation Rebuild Dom Church wants to work together with local vocational education to have the reconstruction be a platform for craftsmanship and community building.</p>
			
			<p><b><i>"This way, our 'Dom city' gets a visible and tangible form."</i></b></p>
			
			<p style="display:none">Quotes from the website of the Foundation Preparation for the Rebuilding of the Nave of the Dom Church (or Rebuild Dom Church for short), herbouwdomkerk.nl/het-idee.</p>
			
			
			
			
			<h2 class="section-heading">Rebuilding the nave means losing the square</h2>
			
			<p>There are many cultural heritage sites around the world where people are debating whether historical constructions should be rebuilt or left as history has left them to us. People are often against rebuilding squares, statues or entire buildings, because they would become contemporary interpretations of the past instead of an exact reconstructions.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Rebuilding the nave would mean destroying part of the past.</p></b>
			
			<p>The missing nave is just as much part of the history of Utrecht as having the nave there. Rebuilding the nave would also mean that the Dom Square as it exists now disappears.</p>
			<p><b>The place that is now the Dom Square is unique in the world.</b></p>
			
			<p>The separation of a church and its tower is a unique sight in itself. Embedded in the vibrant city centre of Utrecht, both compartments have taken on different functions, which is underlined by the physical distance between them.</p>
			
			<p><b>The tower and the church have been separated for centuries.</b></p>
			<p>After they were separated physically by the storm in 1674, Emperor Napoleon separated the ownership of the tower and the church in 1811. The tower was given to the civil authorities, while the church remained in the possession of the church congregation.</p>
			
			<p>The tower and the church still very much interact. The bells in the tower, for example, are used for religious and secular events held in the church.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>The tower and the church have a long and remarkable history together.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>This history is unique to Utrecht, and is contained in stones of buildings. Would rebuilding the nave then take away what makes the Dom Square so special?
			</p>
			
		
			
			
			<h2 class="section-heading">The future is now: can AR be an alternative for reconstruction?</h2>
			
			<p>Digital tools are quickly advancing, and might open up the possibilities for alternative forms of reconstruction. For example, in the form of Augmented Reality (AR).
			</p>
			
			<p><b>The AR model of the nave that you have in front of you can be seen as a preview of what the future might have to offer.</b></p>
			<p>In the coming decades, the quality of AR models and the power of the devices through which we consume these models will continue to increase. AR and VR applications have already been used to bring entire destroyed towns back life, and to map the stars on our mobile devices with Star Chart.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Perhaps, in the future, these models will become more interactive, and users might be able to customize their designs in AR.</p></b>
			<p>As of 2020, Apple has brought out the first mobile devices with LiDaR-scanners, and announced that every future iPhone will be equipped with one. These scanners can be used to very precisely map the direct environment of a smartphone or tablet in 3D. This directly benefits the quality of cameras, but also makes AR more accessible for larger audiences in the near future.</p>
