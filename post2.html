          <p>The storm left the citizens of Utrecht living in a wasteland. The streets were filled with debris, bricks and roof tiles. The guilds deliver 27 men each to clean up the worst of the mess, while local convicts were also tasked to remove the loose rubble.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><b>But what happened to the Dom and its demolished nave?</b></p>
		  
		  <p>Being the largest and most important house of worship in Utrecht, the ruins of the Dom's nave must have been one of the most dramatic and saddening sights in the city. So what happened after the storm? And why was the nave never rebuilt?
		  </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The years after the storm: why was the nave not restored?</h2>
			
						
          <p>Despite being the symbol of Utrecht, no significant efforts were made to rebuild the cathedral after the storm. The city council and the cathedral’s chapter would have been responsible for such a reconstruction, but very little action was taken in the months and years after the catastrophe. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><b>The storm could not have come at a worse moment financially.</b>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>Utrecht's funds were extremely low at this time. The city was still greatly in debt to the French, who had occupied the Netherlands for a year in 1672-3.
		  </p>
		  
		  	  
		  <p><b>Money to completely rebuild the nave was not available.
		  </b></p>
		  
		  <p>Still, the city council pushed for at least a provisional construction of wooden walls and a roof to close off the remainder of the church to make it useable as a place of worship again.
			</p>

			<p>The situation was so bad, that the natural stones from the former nave had to be sold in order to finance the repairs, which ended up taking over three years.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><b>For three long years the church services were held half in the open air.
		  </b></p>
		  
		  <p>The chapter's main concern was the preservation of what was left of the church. The ruins outside, however, were left untouched.
		  </p>
		  
		  
         

          <h2 class="section-heading">Ruins for romance</h2>
			
			<p>For a century and a half, the ruins of the nave remained in the center of the city. Until the ruins were removed, the area was not really used as a public space.  
			</p>
			
			<p><b>The ruins became a seedy place.</p></b>

			<p>The very same place that was once part of God's house, now served as a meeting place for people of all different walks of life. Under the cover of the dilapidated walls and crumbling pillars, those who wished not to be seen could come together.

			<b><p>For years, the ruins were used as a meeting place for local homosexual men.</p></b>

			<p>These men would meet here and express their love under the cover of a ruined church, safe from the condemning eyes of the world.
			</p>

			<b><p>The 'sodomites' were spotted by the guard of the Dom Tower in 1730.</p></b>

			<p>The guard assembled the local authorities, which led to a city-wide persecution of homosexual men. 18 men were trialled and sentenced to death through strangling. A commemorative plaque is placed on the Dom Square to remind us of these persecutions.

			<p><b>The trials inspired a national witch-hunt for homosexual men.</p></b>

			<p>Across the Netherlands hundreds of ‘sodomites’ were killed. Claiming that their sins had incurred the wrath of God, the homosexual men were blamed for the terrible misfortune that Utrecht had faced over the past century, including the nave's collapse.
			</p>
 
			
			
			<h2 class="section-heading">The Dom Square appears</h2>
			
			<p>150 years after the terrible storm the definitive decision was made to not rebuild the nave in any shape or form. The remaining walls and pillars were removed, and an empty space appeared.</p>
			
			<b><p>When the ruins were finally removed, the Dom Square as we know it today finally took shape.</b></p>

			<p><b>A meeting place for locals, newly arrived students and tourists.</b></p>
			
			<p>In the three and a half centuries since the storm, the void left by the nave has been transformed from a religious center to a public meeting place. Over the years the newly formed square became one of the most important public spaces of the city of Utrecht. </p>
			
			<p><b>The separation of the the tower and transept is a unique sight.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>While the nave's collapse was a dramatic event in the history of Utrecht, it also, quite literally, shaped the current city center. Recently, the nave 'returned' to the square in the new pavement, which shows the outline of where the nave once stood. This 'floor plan' reconnects the tower and the church, and helps the square's many visitors imagine what once was.</p>
